This project demonstrates how to integrate Node.js (Express and Apollo/GraphQL) with OpenSearch using Docker containers.

---


## Container used on this project

- **OpenSearch**: A container running OpenSearch to provide a powerful, scalable search engine.
- **Node.js (Express)**: Provides RESTful APIs for querying data from OpenSearch.
- **Node.js (Apollo/GraphQL)**: Utilizes GraphQL for more flexible querying of OpenSearch data.
- **Python Data Loader**: Initializes OpenSearch with preloaded music data.
- **Simple Linux Container**: Provides access to file systems and logs for debugging purposes.
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates all the containers for seamless integration.

## Quick Start



```bash
gh repo clone bygregonline/graphql-express-opensearch-docker-tutorial
cd graphql-express-opensearch-docker-tutorial
docker bu
docker compose -p stack  up -d

```


## Extra

Use a simple linux container to read lod and opensearch file

```bash

docker exec -it simple-container /bin/bash

```


## Tear down service

```bash

```
